# 📘 STL in C++

This repository contains implementations and practice programs for **C++ Standard Template Library (STL)**.  
The goal is to strengthen problem-solving and coding skills using **vectors, pairs, iterators, functions, and more**.

---

## 📂 Topics Covered
- ✅ Vectors  
- ✅ Pairs  
- ✅ Iterators  
- ✅ Insertion & Deletion  
- ✅ Functions  

---

## ⚡ How to Compile & Run

1. Open terminal inside the project folder.  
2. Compile any file using:  
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp
   ./a

# 📚 STL in C++ – Day 2

## 📌 Topics Learned
- **Stack**
  - Basic operations: `push()`, `pop()`, `top()`, `empty()`
  - `swap()` → Exchanges the contents of two stacks in constant time.  
    Example:  
    If `s1 = {1,2,3}` and `s2 = {4,5}`,  
    after `s1.swap(s2)`:  
    - `s1 = {4,5}`  
    - `s2 = {1,2,3}`  

- **Deque**
  - Double-ended queue supporting insertion/deletion from both ends.  
  - Functions: `push_back()`, `push_front()`, `pop_back()`, `pop_front()`, `at()`, `front()`, `back()`.

- **List**
  - Doubly linked list implementation.  
  - Allows fast insertion and deletion anywhere.  
  - Functions: `push_back()`, `push_front()`, `insert()`, `erase()`, `remove()`, `sort()`, `reverse()`.

- ## 📂 Topics Covered
- ✅Stack
- ✅ Deque
- ✅ List

---

## ✅ Practice
- Implemented **Stack Swap Example** with a helper function to print elements.  
- Tried **Deque and List** with insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## 🏷️ Day Summary
Today’s focus was on **STL Containers** (Stack, Deque, List) — building a strong foundation in C++ STL, which is highly useful in DSA and competitive programming.
